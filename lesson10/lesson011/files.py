# files exercise

'''
1.Write a Python program that asks the user for their name and age, and then writes this information to a file named john.txt.
Example:
Name: John
Age: 20
'''
name=input(str(f"Enter your name:"))
age=int(input(f"Enter your age:"))

# your code here

'''
2. Create another Python program which asks the user in which file their information is, opens the file, reads and prints it. Don’t forget to handle the case where the user provides a filename that doesn’t exist and prints that.
Example:
Please provide a file with your information: C:/Users/me/john.txt
1.Write a function that accepts as arguments a name and an age, and prints “Name: xxx, Age: yyy”. Use the function in the program.
2.Write a function that accepts 3 numbers and returns to the user the biggest of the three numbers.
3.Create a list of numbers and use filter() to filter out all the even numbers.
HINT: first you will need to declare a function “is_even(number)” which returns true if the number is even.
4.Create a list of strings and use map() to create another list where each string is the same but all caps.
1.EXAMPLE: [“hello”, “World”] -> [“HELLO”, “WORLD”]
HINT: first you will need to declare a function which accepts a string and returns it in all caps
